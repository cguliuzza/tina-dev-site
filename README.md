This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

**Next.js is a full-stack framework built on top of React.**
React gives you functions written in JSX to build UI components.
Next.js does everything else for you!

## Where is This App Deployed?

This Next.js app is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

## Let's Get This Server Started

yarn next dev
control + C to close the server on MAC
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Create and Commit a Branch

git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push
```

### How Do APIs Work in Next.js 13?

Add a `pages/api` directory

* It will be mapped to `/api/*`. 

* Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### What fonts are used?
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
